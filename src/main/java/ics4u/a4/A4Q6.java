/**
 * Assignment 4
 * Question 6
 * A circle in the Cartesian plane can be described uniquely by its centre and its radius.
 * Thus, a class called Circle that could be used to represent such circles might start with the following:
 * class Circle {
 * double x; // x-coordinate of centre
 * double y; // y-coordinate of centre
 * double r; // radius
 * }
 * An object of this class, representing a circle with centre at (5,2) and having radius 3 is shown in the next diagram.
 * Using this class, write a Java program that performs the following actions.
 * (a) Create Circle objects c1 and c2 where c1 represents a circle with centre at (1,2)
 * having radius 4 while c2 represents a circle with centre at (âˆ’2,0) having radius 2.
 * (b) Set the double variable distance to the distance from the origin to the centre of c1 and then print this value.
 * (c) Set the double variable centreSeparationequal to the distance between the centres of c1 and c2 and then print this value.
 * (d) Set the double variable minDistance to the minimum distance from a point on c1 to a point on c2 and then print this value.
