/**
 * Assignment 8
 * Question 2
 * (a) For the child development study discussed in this section, write a method
 * that could be added to the Child class that prints the data (name, age, height,
 * and sex) for a child on two lines with the name on the Ô¨Årst line and the other
 * data on the second line. Print the height in centimetres, rounded to the nearest
 * centimetre.
 * <p>
 * (b) Write a fragment that uses this method to print the data on all the children.
 * <p>
 * (c) Write a method that would produce the same output as the method shown in part
 * (a) if we had chosen to use parallel arrays rather than an array of objects to
 * represent our data.
